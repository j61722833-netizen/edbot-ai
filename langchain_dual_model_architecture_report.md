# LangChain Dual-Model Architecture Report
## Citation-Based Q&A and Fact-Checking System for Textbooks

### Executive Summary

This report outlines the architecture for a LangChain-based system involving two specialized models:
1. **Citation Q&A Model**: Answers questions based on textbook content and provides source citations
2. **Fact-Checking Model**: Verifies claims and citations for accuracy

The system leverages cutting-edge 2025 LangChain technologies including LangGraph multi-agent workflows, Chain of Verification (CoVe), and advanced RAG pipelines with built-in citation capabilities.

## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Citation Q&A Model Implementation

#### Document Processing Pipeline
```python
# Pseudo-code structure
class TextbookProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
            chunk_size=1000,
            chunk_overlap=200
        )
        self.embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
        self.vectorstore = FAISS.from_documents()
    
    def process_textbook(self, textbook_path):
        # Load and chunk textbook content
        # Add paragraph-level IDs for citation
        # Store in vector database with metadata
```

#### Citation-Enabled RAG Chain
```python
# Structured output for citations
class CitedResponse(BaseModel):
    answer: str
    citations: List[Citation]
    
class Citation(BaseModel):
    source_id: str
    page_number: int
    paragraph_id: str
    quote: str
```

#### Vector Database Schema
- **Content**: Textbook paragraph text
- **Metadata**: 
  - `book_title`: Source textbook title
  - `page_number`: Page reference
  - `paragraph_id`: Unique paragraph identifier
  - `chapter`: Chapter information
  - `section`: Section headers

### 2. Fact-Checking Model Implementation

#### Chain of Verification (CoVe) Workflow
1. **Baseline Response Analysis**: Parse claims from Q&A response
2. **Verification Question Generation**: Create specific verification queries
3. **Execute Verification**: Independent fact-checking using external sources
4. **Final Assessment**: Synthesize verification results

#### Multi-Agent Verification System
```python
# LangGraph multi-agent architecture
class FactCheckingAgents:
    - ClaimExtractor: Identifies factual claims
    - CitationValidator: Verifies source accuracy
    - ExternalSearcher: Queries external databases
    - AccuracyGrader: Assesses overall reliability
```

## Workflow Options

### Option 1: Sequential Pipeline
**Flow**: User Query → Q&A Model → Fact-Checker → Response
- **Pros**: Simple implementation, clear verification trail
- **Cons**: Higher latency, sequential processing

### Option 2: Parallel Verification
**Flow**: User Query → Q&A Model + Parallel Fact-Checking → Synthesis
- **Pros**: Faster response time, real-time verification
- **Cons**: More complex orchestration, higher resource usage

### Option 3: Agentic RAG with Integrated Verification
**Flow**: User Query → Multi-Agent System (Q&A + Verification) → Response
- **Pros**: Most sophisticated, best accuracy, adaptive workflow
- **Cons**: Complex implementation, requires careful agent coordination
